<span style="font-size:1.25em;">We are a Chemistry research group based at the [School of Chemistry](https://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/) at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). We combine synthesis, computational chemistry, programming, and spectroscopy to understand the properties of pi-conjugated organic molecules. </span>

<span style="font-size:1.25em;">Organic molecules are those which are mostly made up of carbon. By using skilled chemical synthesis to exactly engineer the structure of molecules,we can access a wide range of properties: whether as medicines, dyes, molecular wires, or more. Our group's research is based on the latter two categories. We design molecules using computational chemistry, make them using organic synthesis, and then study them with advanced spectroscopies.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.25em;">Take a look around the site to learn a bit more about what we do. If you're interested in working with us, whether you're a potential student, an industry partner, or a collaborator, <a href="#contact">just get in touch</a>.</span>
