Nature is an expert at self-assembly. Your body, as a whole, is a complex compartmentalised system of molecules, reactions, and replicators, all underpinned by self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry.

We explore self-assembly processes and their use towards making new materials and exploring structure-property relationships. In a chemical space traditionally dominated by extended pi-conjugated systems, we explore how through-space energy transfer and excitonic effects can deliver excellent materials properties.
