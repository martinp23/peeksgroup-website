 abstract = {Despite its history as one of the oldest concepts in chemistry, the definition of aromaticity continues to be the subject of debate. Notably, it continues to develop and to evolve – and to survive calls for its abandonment. In practice, the concept of aromaticity is used by chemists to explain and predict myriad molecular properties, typically without great attention to its formal definition. This review aims to introduce aromaticity from two perspectives: first, the traditional historical and definitional perspective, then from the viewpoint of an observer asking “how do chemists actually use the concept of ‘aromaticity’?”.
