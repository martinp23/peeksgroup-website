abstract: 'Despite its history as one of the oldest concepts in chemistry, the definition
  of aromaticity continues to be the subject of debate. Notably, it continues to develop
  and to evolve – and to survive calls for its abandonment. In practice, the concept
  of aromaticity is used by chemists to explain and predict myriad molecular properties,
  typically without great attention to its formal definition. This review aims to
  introduce aromaticity from two perspectives: first, the traditional historical and
  definitional perspective, then from the viewpoint of an observer asking “how do
  chemists actually use the concept of ‘aromaticity’?”. Keywords Aromaticity; Ring
  currents; Benzene; Conjugation; Antiaromaticity'
