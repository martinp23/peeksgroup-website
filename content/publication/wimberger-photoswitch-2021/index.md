abstract: "Molecular photoswitches capable of generating precise pH changes will allow pH-dependent processes to be controlled remotely and noninvasively with light. We introduce a series of new merocyanine photoswitches, which deliver reversible bulk pH changes up to 3.2 pH units (pH 6.5 to pH 3.3) upon irradiation with 450 nm light, displaying tunable and predictable timescales for thermal recovery.
