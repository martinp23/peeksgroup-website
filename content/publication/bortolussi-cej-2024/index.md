abstract: Abstract Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic
  chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic
  properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic
  using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational
  analyses of porphyrin (18π neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16π neutral, antiaromatic),
  and their oxidized (16π porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18π dianion)
  forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity
  consistent with Hückel's rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing
  to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment
  of (anti)aromaticity in both ground-state and time-resolved spectra.
