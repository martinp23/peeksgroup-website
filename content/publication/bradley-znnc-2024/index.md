abstract: ' Zinc norcorrole was prepared as its pyridine complex (ZnNc路pyridine) by
  metalation of freebase norcorrole. The ZnNc路pyridine complex is distinctly bowl-shaped,
  as demonstrated by both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
  spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy showed characteristic ring current deshielding effects,
  with different magnitudes on either face of the bowl-shaped complex. Exchanging
  the pyridine ligand with the bidentate ligand DABCO results in the formation of
  a stable (ZnNc)2路DABCO sandwich complex, which was also characterized by crystallography
  and NMR spectroscopy. The NMR resonances of the axial ligands in all of the complexes
  demonstrate that the paratropic ring current in zinc norcorrole is approximately
  40 nA/T, which is comparable in magnitude to the diatropic ring current in porphyrin.
  Analysis of the ligand-exchange processes on addition of DABCO to ZnNc路pyridine
  showed that ZnNc coordinates to axial nitrogen-containing ligands with approximately
  1000-fold higher binding constants than analogous zinc porphyrins. '
