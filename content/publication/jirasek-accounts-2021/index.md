abstract: "The ring currents of aromatic and antiaromatic molecules are remarkable emergent phenomena. A ring current is a quantum-mechanical feature of the whole system, and its existence cannot be inferred from the properties of the individual components of the ring. Hückel’s rule states that when an aromatic molecule with a circuit of [4n + 2] π electrons is placed in a magnetic field, the field induces a ring current that creates a magnetic field opposing the external field inside the ring.
