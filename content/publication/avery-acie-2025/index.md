abstract: Reciprocal allosteric regulation, where binding events 
  influence each other simultaneously, is a key target for supramolecular 
  chemists designing biomimetic systems. Platinum(II) lantern-shaped cages, 
  formed from a series of ligands bearing central protonatable sites of varied 
  basicity through rational tuning of the backbone, featured nuanced dual action
  host-guest chemistry. This reveals the first example of reciprocal allostery 
  in a supramolecular system, between protonation and anion binding. Switching 
  studies were conducted using acid/base and silver/chloride stimuli, with 
  single and multi-anion systems.
