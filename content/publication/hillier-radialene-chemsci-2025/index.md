abstract: The unusual [3]radialene motif at the centre of triquino[3]radialene permits
  exceptional electronic conjugation between the three quinone arms of the molecule,
  giving rise to a remarkably low-energy and intense absorption spectrum. Since triquino[3]radialene’s
  initial synthesis in the 1970s, questions have been posed around the molecule’s
  potential diradical(oid) character. In this work we present new synthetic approaches
  to triquino[3]radialene and a thorough spectroscopic and computational evaluation
  of its properties. Despite broad UV-visible absorption, the triquino[3]radialene
  is non-emissive. An investigation by transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that
  the initially-formed excited state of triquino[3]radialene decays to a triplet state
  with a lifetime of 0.82 µs. Using computational chemistry, we compare triquino[3]radialene
  to Yang’s biradical and galvionxyl, with which it is structurally similar. DFT reveals
  insights into the role of aromaticity in the photoexcited triplet state, where quinoidal
  rings become more aromatic. MCSCF and CIPT2 calculations reproduce the experimental
  spectra and reveal a diradical character of y=0.05 in triquino[3]radialene.
