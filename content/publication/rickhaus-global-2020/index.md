abstract: "Does aromaticity have a size limit? Evidence is presented for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 π-electrons. The conformation of the nanoring can be altered by changing the template, which in turn controls the aromaticity. Whenever a ring current is observed, its direction is correctly predicted by Hückel’s rule."
