# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Stephen is from Sydney, Australia, and originally joined the Peeks group as an honours student in 2020, looking into the properties of liquid crystalline materials. He returned to the group in 2021 to start his PhD in Chemistry at UNSW. The current direction of his research is computational and synthetic studies into the electronic properties of (anti)aromatic molecules. He is also a teaching fellow with the UNSW School of Chemistry, and has an active role in the [Students of Chemistry Society (SOCS)](https://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/current-students/undergraduate/socs).
