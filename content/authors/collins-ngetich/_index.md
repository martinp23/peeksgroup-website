bio: I’m Collins from Kenya. Currently a PhD student at Peeks group UNSW and enjoying life in Sydney by the beach. I completed my Master’s in the Stepien's group at the University of Wroclaw, then pharmaceutical industry experience in Poland. My research interests are π-conjugated materials in different shapes and topologies. When I’m not in the lab, you’ll probably find me at the beach, out on my road bike, or playing beach volleyball.
