Originally from the North West of England, near to Liverpool, Martin went north to the University of St Andrews for his undergraduate chemistry (MChem) degree. There his interest in supramolecular and physical-organic chemistry was sparked by research projects with Prof Doug Philp (2nd year).

He then moved to the University of Oxford to work with Prof Harry L. Anderson for his DPhil (Oxford's name for a PhD). During his DPhil he explored electronic delocalization in molecular wires: specifically, porphyrin oligomers and nanorings. The project gave him extensive experience in the fundamentals of conjugated polymer chemistry, and aromaticity.

In April 2017 he was awarded a Lindemann Trust Fellowship from the English Speaking Union, which supported his work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Prof Timothy M. Swager's group, exploring magneto-optical polymers and other materials. From December 2018 to March 2019, he returned to work in the Anderson group at Oxford, when his work at MIT was disrupted by visa issuance delays from the US government. 

In June 2019, Martin started the Peeks group when he took up a Scientia Fellowship at UNSW Sydney. Research in the group explores the use of supramolecular chemistry to develop structure-property relationships for functional materials, and he retains an interest in exploring the nature and applications of (anti)aromaticity.

Outside of this, Martin retains an interest in coding (some projects are shared on github) and open science.
