*   [**Not Voodoo**](http://www2.chem.rochester.edu/~nvd/) - great compendium of knowledge for chemistry
*   [**Org Syn**](http://www.orgsyn.org/) - journal of proven synthetic routes
*   [**JOC Common Solvent Impurities article**](https://www3.nd.edu/~hgao/JOC1997p7512.pdf) - useful desk reference
*   [_**Organometallics**_ **Common Solvent Impurities article**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om100106e) - useful desk reference
*   [**SBDS spectrum search engine**](https://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/sdbs/cgi-bin/cre_index.cgi) - can help with characterisation. Thousands of reference spectra.
*   [**Organic Chemistry Portal**](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/) - excellent set of resources, some picked out below:
    *   [**Named reaction reference**](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/)
    *   [**Protecting group selection guides**](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/protectivegroups/)
*   [**List of TLC stains**](https://www.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/adronov/resources/Stains_for_Developing_TLC_Plates.pdf) -- summary of my preferred ones:
    *   Permanganate: good general stain, for compounds with oxidisable sites. Heat to develop.
    *   CAM: good general stain. Heat to develop.
    *   Iodine: great stain for alkynes and alkenes
    *   2,4-DNP: useful stain selective for aldehydes and ketones
